# üöÄ Self-Driven MERN Stack Internship (15 June ‚Äì 15 July 2025)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **‚ÄúRejected by companies. Accepted by the grind.‚Äù**  
> This is my solo internship ‚Äî built with discipline, vision, and the goal to become job-ready in 30 days.  
> **I‚Äôm not waiting for opportunities. I‚Äôm creating them.**

---

## üìå Overview

This is a **self-directed MERN Stack internship** I‚Äôm running solo from **June 15 to July 15, 2025**.  
It‚Äôs structured like a real internship ‚Äî daily logging, milestone tracking, and hands-on projects ‚Äî with accountability in public.  
No certificates, no fluff ‚Äî just **real proof of work**.

---

## üéØ Internship Goals

- ‚úÖ Become MERN-ready (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)  
- ‚úÖ Build and deploy 3+ MERN stack projects  
- ‚úÖ Log daily progress publicly and consistently  
- ‚úÖ Create a strong developer portfolio before July 15, 2025  
- ‚úÖ Apply for jobs, freelance, or paid work starting mid-July  

---

## üî• Why I Curated This Internship

I‚Äôve been rejected from companies that judge candidates by marks, not skills.  
So I designed this 30-day internship for myself ‚Äî where:

- I‚Äôm my own manager, mentor, and intern.  
- I set deadlines, ship code, and stay consistent.  
- I use public GitHub logs to **prove** my journey.  

> [!TIP]
> This isn‚Äôt just practice. It‚Äôs **preparation + demonstration**.  
> If companies won't hire me for an internship, I'll build one myself ‚Äî better than theirs.
